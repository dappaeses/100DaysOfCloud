   • EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS’ offering
• EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
• It mainly consists in the capability of :
• Renting virtual machines (EC2)
• Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
• Distributing load across machines (ELB)
• Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)
• Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the Cloud works

- EC2 Sizing & Configuration Option
     Operating System (OS): Linux, Windows or Mac OS 
     • How much compute power & cores (CPU) 
     • How much random-access memory (RAM) 
     • How much storage space: 
        • Network-attached (EBS & EFS) 
        • hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
     • Network card: speed of the card, Public IP address 
     • Firewall rules: security group
