## EC2 On Demand

• Pay for what you use:

  • Linux or Windows - billing per second, after the first minute
  
	• All other operating systems - billing per hour
  
• Has the highest cost but no upfront payment

• No long-term commitment

• Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads, where you can't predict how the application will behave
