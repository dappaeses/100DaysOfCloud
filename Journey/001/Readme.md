# Linux Fundamental aguna course, meet 1, virtual machine fundamental aguna course

## Introduction
First of all I will learn Linux before I learn the cloud

- Meet 1
- linux fundamental
- virtual machine fundamental

## Cloud Research
his is the material that I studied on the first day. I attended meet 1 from the application and took a fundamental Linux and virtual machine fundamental course from the Aguna course
- Linux fundamental dan meet 1 

i am studying linux file hierarchy Linux file hierarchy, First of all we discuss the highest, namely the root directory which is marked with a sign (/), the second is the /bin directory which contains the required commands, the next is the /etc directory in this /etc directory for save configuration files like we want to configure network, netplan, apache2 and others. Next, there is the /usr directory, this directory is for placing files that we install like we have just installed something like that on Ubuntu, for example, it is placed in the /usr directory. Next, there is the /var directory in this directory, which contains server logs, etc. This log also functions for monitoring as well. next, there is the /bin directory, this directory contains the essential command programs needed by all users. programs here can run, even if no other filesystems are mounted. This directory has no subdirectories. next there is the /boot directory which is a directory that functions to store configuration and files related to the boot process, load the Linux Kernel and boot loader. and I also learned basic Linux commands like cp to copy, pwd to see where we are, and various types of ls like ls -al and ls -la to see hidden files and their access rights, there's more mv to rename and move files and the existing directory cd to go to another directory rm to delete the file rm -r to delete the directory that contains it



- virtual machine fundamental 

I studied hypervisors where hypervisors function like applications to install virtual machines, examples of hypervisors are ESX, Oracle and others, and I will discuss virtualization, which is technology for creating virtual servers, storage and networks.
