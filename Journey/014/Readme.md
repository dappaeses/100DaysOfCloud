## EC2 Instance Store
• EBS volumes are network drives with good but “limited” performance

• If you need a high-performance hardware disk, use EC2 Instance Store

• Better I/O performance

• EC2 Instance Store lose their storage if they’re stopped (ephemeral)

• Good for buffer / cache / scratch data / temporary content

• Risk of data loss if hardware fails

• Backups and Replication are your responsibility
