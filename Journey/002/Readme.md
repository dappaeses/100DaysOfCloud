- Static Routing
On the second day I studied routing, especially static routing, which is how routing functions to connect between different networks, if you don't understand the fundamental network concept, please learn it first, then eventually you will understand the concept of routing. Okay continue, today I studied static routing, how did I tell you that routing functions to connect devices such as routers, it can be from any vendor, yes, static routing I implemented this routing to an application, namely GNS3 and I tried it with several routers and it was very effective For static routing itself, it has the advantage of being safer and more secure. The downside is that it is complicated, for example in large companies the routers are usually a lot more complicated when using static routing.
